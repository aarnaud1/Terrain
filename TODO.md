# TODO list

- [ ] Remove sky artefacts on cubeMap edges, maybe compute the sky color in a fragment shader
- [ ] Use deferred shading
- [ ] Use an adaptative mesh grid instead of a fixed grid
- [ ] Use a fixed framebuffer size (different from the screen size)
- [ ] Improve compute shaders performances
- [ ] Add separate class for each rendered object (terrain, sky, water, ...)
- [ ] Investigate clip distance validation layer issue
